Step 1: Create Network Topology

Open Cisco Packet Tracer.

Drag and drop:

1 Layer 2 Switch (2960)

2 PCs (PC0 and PC1)

Use Copper Straight-Through Cables to connect:

PC0 → Switch (FastEthernet0/1)

PC1 → Switch (FastEthernet0/2)

Step 2: Assign IP Addresses

Click on PC0 → Desktop → IP Configuration

IP Address: 192.168.1.2

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Click on PC1 → Desktop → IP Configuration

IP Address: 192.168.1.3

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Step 3: Test Connectivity Using Ping

On PC0 → Desktop → Command Prompt, type:

ping 192.168.1.3


You should see replies like:

Reply from 192.168.1.3: bytes=32 time<1ms TTL=128


✅ This confirms successful communication between the two PCs through the switch.

Step 5: Capture Packets Using Simulation Mode

Click on the Simulation Mode icon (Stopwatch) at the bottom-right of the Packet Tracer.

On PC0, again type:

ping 192.168.1.3


Observe the packets (ICMP Request and Reply) moving between the PCs in the Simulation Window.

Click on the packets to view detailed info such as:

Source and Destination MAC Addresses

IP Addresses

ICMP Echo Request and Echo Reply details

Result:

A wired LAN was successfully created using a Layer 2 switch.
The communication between PCs was verified using the Ping utility, and the ICMP packets were captured and analyzed using Cisco Packet Tracer’s Simulation Mode.
