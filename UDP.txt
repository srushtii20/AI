step 1:Make a folder 
for example:
📁 UDP_File_Transfer

step 2:
save file as server.py and copy this in it

import socket
import os

UDP_IP = "0.0.0.0"       # Listen on all network interfaces
UDP_PORT = 5001
BUFFER_SIZE = 1024

# Create UDP socket
server_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
server_socket.bind((UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))

print("UDP Server starting...")
print(f"UDP Server is listening on port {UDP_PORT}...")

# Receive filename first
data, addr = server_socket.recvfrom(BUFFER_SIZE)
filename = data.decode()
filename = os.path.basename(filename)       # remove path if sent
save_as = "received_" + filename
print(f"Receiving file: {filename} from {addr}")

with open(save_as, "wb") as f:
    chunk_count = 0
    while True:
        data, addr = server_socket.recvfrom(BUFFER_SIZE)
        if data == b'EOF':                   # EOF marker from client
            print("End of file reached.")
            break
        f.write(data)
        chunk_count += 1
        print(f"Received chunk #{chunk_count}, {len(data)} bytes")

print(f"\nFile received successfully as '{save_as}'")
server_socket.close()

step 2:
save one more file as client.py 
import socket
import os

UDP_IP = input("Enter server IP address: ")
UDP_PORT = 5001
BUFFER_SIZE = 1024

filename = input("Enter the file name to send: ")
basename = os.path.basename(filename)  # just the file name

client_socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

# Send filename first
client_socket.sendto(basename.encode(), (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
print(f"Filename '{basename}' sent to server.")

# Send file data
with open(filename, "rb") as f:
    chunk_count = 0
    while True:
        chunk = f.read(BUFFER_SIZE)
        if not chunk:
            break
        client_socket.sendto(chunk, (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
        chunk_count += 1
        print(f"Sent chunk #{chunk_count}, {len(chunk)} bytes")

# Send EOF marker
client_socket.sendto(b'EOF', (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))
print("File sent successfully.")

client_socket.close()

step 3:Create a Sample Text File

Open a new Notepad file.

Type something simple like:

This is a UDP file transfer test.

Save it as → udp.txt
in the same folder (UDP_File_Transfer).

step 4:open cmd change the path to servers file path after changing put this "python server.py"
output:
"UDP Server is up and listening on port 5001..."

step 5 :open cmd again change path to client file path and then put "python client.py"
output:
Enter server IP address: 127.0.0.1
Enter the file name to send: udp.txt
File sent successfully.
Server response: File received successfully.

step 6: again check server cmd it will show this nowUDP Server is up and listening on port 5001...
Receiving file: udp.txt from ('127.0.0.1', 59596)
File 'udp.txt' received successfully and saved as 'received_udp.txt'
